	<h1>Welcome!</h1>
	<p>This is my little corner of the Internet.</p>
	<p>I mostly write about technology, workflow improvement and personal development, but I'll occasionally weigh in on
		my thoughts about the state of the world.</p>
	<p>There are many things that I don't like about the modern Internet, one of them being that everyone feels the need
		to share their every opinion. There I'll carefully consider if what I have to say actualy adds anything new to the
		conversation.</p>

	<p>Another thing that I find incredibly annoying is the amount of Javascript that is apparently needed on many sites
		just to display a few paragraphs of text. In an effort to show that the web is perfectly usable without a concoction
		of frameworks, plugins and ad tracking, I built this site without any of that. Hopefully this has made for a snappy
		experience regardless of your device and/or internet connection.</p>

	<p>Please enjoy your stay.</p>
