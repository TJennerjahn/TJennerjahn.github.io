<h1>Too much noise in the world</h1>
<p>Today I woke up with a particular feeling. It's not the first time I've felt like this and it won't be the last.
I'm not suprised that I woke up like this. I knew it was coming.</p>
<p>There's too much noise in the world. Too many things trying to grab my attention.
Too many ads trying to sell me products I don't need. Too many articles and newsletters and tweets and toots and whatever else telling me how to feel about the world.</p>
<p>I cannot bear it any longer. And so I retreat. I uninstall Youtube and Reddit from my phone. I unsubscribe from mailing lists, I block Hacker News in my router settings, I cancel my Netflix subscription.</p>
<p>It's my fault alone that the noise has become overwhelming. I let myself indulge in it, which I know isn't good for me.
But I cannot help it. The technology is too good. Precisely tuned to show me content that tickles my brain.</p>
<p>So I rip it out. No more ads, no more political propaganda, no more Livestream drama. No more noise.</p>
<p>It will be blissfull silence for the first few days.
But it won't last. The silence will turn into excruciating boredom. Boredom that I'll fight by being hyper-productive.
The next few weeks of productivity will raise my confidence. &quot;Finally I've escaped the social media hell&quot;. But I know that's a lie.</p>
<p>Eventually I will give in and reward myself with a Youtube Video. Something educational that I feel good about having spent my time watching it. I won't realize it until much later, but that's the moment I will have doomed myself to repeat the cycle.</p>
<p>Until one day I wake up with a particular feeling...</p>
